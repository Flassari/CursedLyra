# Cursed Lyra

An Unreal Engine Gameplay Feature Plugin showing bad performance practices for the Lyra Starter Game.

## Getting Up and Running

Put this project into Lyra/Plugins/GameFeatures/CursedLyra.

### MegaScans
L_HugeMap references some Megascan assets that are not included to keep this repository size manageable. Download some big Megascan assets in Nanite quality, and then disable Nanite on them to bloat their vertex count. Then place them in this plugin folder and place the meshes in L_HugeMap.

For reference, these are the assets I used:
- Huge_Canyon_Sandstone_Hoodoo_vepnfcr
- Huge_Canyon_Sandstone_Rock_Formation_umdrfdxga
- Massive_Canyon_Sandstone_Cliff_vb1macxfa
- Massive_Canyon_Sandstone_Hoodoo_vjqiaa2qx
- Quarry_Cliff_ubhvccfda
- Quarry_Cliff_ubjuddqda
